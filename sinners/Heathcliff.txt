                            This Sinner prefers to take action rather than wait for logic to dictate his course. His
                            thoughts and feelings are blatantly visible in his demeanor, and he has no intention of
                            hiding them; his brashness may cause headaches (or physical injury leading to a headache) in
                            the process of forming a relationship. Please do note that this is not an indication of
                            serious damage to the Sinner's thought process. If his fit of rage persists, please contact
                            the human resources department. Once you realize that he is the type that tends to be
                            simple-minded, you'll have an easier time handling him.
