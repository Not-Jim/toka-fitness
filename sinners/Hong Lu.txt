                            A Sinner who had lived an affluent life before becoming our company's asset. As such, he has
                            a certain admiration for a free life; but occasionally, he may make ignorant and unsavory
                            questions in regards to the food cooked by a certain other Sinner or other aspects of the
                            low-lives' lowly culture. This can cause much irritation for the other Sinners. However, it
                            is important to note that no sarcastic undertones are contained in his curiosity-driven
                            inquiries, so it is ill-advised to let them get physical over it.
