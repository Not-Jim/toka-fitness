                            Even with the volatile nature of human growth around his age taken into consideration, this
                            Sinner seems to get particularly startled or frown when spoken to. He isn't used to real
                            combat at the moment, meaning that he may struggle to keep himself together at the sight of
                            something as mild as spilt innards at first. As there may be those with violent tendencies
                            among your crew, we recommend taking an approach focused on positive reinforcement with this
                            Sinner. He appears to possess a murderous gaze that he himself isn't aware of; this is a
                            hopeful sign that he has the potential to grow into an expert of our company's profession
                            with the right stimuli.
